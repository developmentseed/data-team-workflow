Machine Learning image classification projects are characterized by reviewing large amounts of images, looking for certain patterns, characteristics in each image e.g:

- School patterns
- Vacant lots
- Types of crops
- etc. 


Development Seed's data-team has built its own tools to address these types of challenges, which allow us quick reviews.
