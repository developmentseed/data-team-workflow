Machine Learning image classification projects are characterized by reviewing large amounts of images, looking for certain patterns,
School patterns, vacant lots, crop types,

Development data-team along with Machine Learning engineering have built workflow and tools to review large numbers of images in an easy way. Our statistics demonstrate the efficiency of the tools and data-team at image classification.

Development Seed's data-team has built its own tools to address these types of challenges, which allow us quick reviews.

The list below of shows the tools that data-team use for image classification ðŸ‘‡

## Chip-ahoy

An open source tool, used for validating machine learning chips.

## Relabeler

An open source tool, used for validating map tiles chips

## Java OpenStreetMap editor

Java OpenStreetMap editor, known as JOSM is an open source tool. JOSM tool works with map tiles. Points, lines and polygons editions are very flexible compared with Qgis, data-team uses JOSM together with [osm-seed](https://github.com/developmentseed/osm-seed). Also during years Development seed engineers got expericice customizing JOSM for our own purposes.
