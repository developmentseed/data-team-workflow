Machine Learning image classification projects are characterized by reviewing large amounts of images, looking for certain patterns, characteristics in each image e.g:

- School patterns
- Vacant lots
- Types of crops
- etc.

Development Seed's data-team has built its own tools to address these types of challenges, which allow us quick reviews.

- Chip-ahoy: Used for validating machine learning chips.
- Relabeler: Used for validating map tiles chips

### Statistics

Our statistics demonstrate the efficiency of the tools and our team when doing the job of classifying images.

| Num clases per image | Images per hour |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| 1                    | 1,000           |
| 2                    | 800             |
| 3                    | 700             |
| 4                    | 600             |
