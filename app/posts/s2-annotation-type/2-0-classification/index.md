Machine Learning image classification projects are characterized by reviewing large amounts of images, looking for certain patterns, characteristics in each image e.g:

- School patterns
- Vacant lots
- Types of crops
- etc.

Our statistics demonstrate the efficiency of the tools and data-team at image classification.

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Num clases per image</th>
      <th scope="col">Images per hour</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>800</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>700</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>600</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Development Seed's data-team has built its own tools to address these types of challenges, which allow us quick reviews.

The list below of shows the tools that data-team use for image classification ðŸ‘‡

## Chip-ahoy

An open source tool, used for validating machine learning chips.

## Relabeler

An open source tool, used for validating map tiles chips

## Java OpenStreetMap editor

Java OpenStreetMap editor as know as JOSM is an open source tool, that can work for map tiles classification too, our engineering has expericice customizing this tool for our own purposes.
