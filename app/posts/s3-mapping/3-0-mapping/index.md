The Data team, has mapped, and edited more than 25 million objects in OpenStreetMap, and created routable road networks for the biggest names in navigation, so Development Seed's Data team is among the best in the world at creating and improving map data. The Data team has extensive experience with the OSM ecosystem, software stack, and metadata standards. Something to keep in mind is that the Data team members come to Development Seed from Mapbox where they worked on several of the biggest and toughest mapping challenges.

The Data team offers data with high quality and also a good average on mapping. However, the density and complexity of the features to map, and the quality of the satellite imagery influence the mapping averages, so these are some factors the Data team takes into account when making a quote.  

In the case of buildings and highways, the mapping average is classified according to the density as low, intermediate, and high.

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"; style="width: 25%; text-align: center">Low</th>
      <th scope="col"; style="width: 25%; text-align: center">Intermediate</th>
      <th scope="col"; style="width: 25%;text-align: center">High</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/assets/images/mapping_low_density.png"/>            
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="/assets/images/mapping_intermediate_density.png"/>            
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="/assets/images/mapping_high_density.png"/>            
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: justify; padding: 12px;">Where there are only a few buildings and highways. This type of density can be seen in rural areas.</td>
      <td style="text-align: justify; padding: 12px;">Where there are a lot of buildings and highways. This type of density can be seen in urban areas.</td>
      <td style="text-align: justify; padding: 12px;">Where there are a lot of buildings and highways, in addition, the buildings are well together. This type of density can be seen in urban areas.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

On the other hand, in the case of farms, the mapping average is classified according to the complexity as low, medium, and high.  

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col"; style="width: 25%; text-align: center">Low</th>
      <th scope="col"; style="width: 25%; text-align: center">Medium</th>
      <th scope="col"; style="width: 25%; text-align: center">High</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="/assets/images/mapping_low_complexity.png"/>            
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="/assets/images/mapping_medium_complexity.png"/>               
      </td>
      <td> 
        <img src="/assets/images/mapping_high_complexity.png"/>               
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: justify; padding: 12px;">Where the farm shape is simple.</td>
      <td style="text-align: justify; padding: 12px;">Where the farm shape has a few edges.</td>
      <td style="text-align: justify; padding: 12px;">Where the farm shape has complex edges.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Data team's mapping tools
The Data team, for mapping, use these tools:

- [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) as an editor, where the Data team can do easier and faster the editions.
- [Tasking Manager](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager), for dividing the AOI into small areas in order to each mapper can select a task, and avoid conflicts.
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), a collaborative project to create free and editable maps.
