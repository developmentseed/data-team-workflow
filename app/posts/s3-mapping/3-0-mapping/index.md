The team has mapped and edited more than 25 million objects in OpenStreetMap and created routable road networks for the biggest names in navigation, so this team is among the best in the world at creating and improving map data. The team has extensive experience with the OSM ecosystem, software stack, and metadata standards. Something to keep in mind is that Data team members come to Development Seed from Mapbox where they worked on several of the biggest and toughest mapping challenges.

The projects where the team has participated are:

- Traicing San Francisco buildings
- Mapping and Aligning road network in Taiwan based on new Mapbox imagery and Strava
- Los Angeles Building Import
- Turn lanes mapping project
- Machine learning tower detection and Mapping Work
- Farm fields mapping
- Mapping commercial farms in Ethiopia
- Building footprint
