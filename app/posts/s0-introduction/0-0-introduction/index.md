Development Seed's Data team is one of the most prolific and accomplished mapping teams in the world. They have extensive experience with the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, geospatial software ecosystem, and metadata standards. They are also at the forefront of building open and highly efficient workflows for mapping and building complex machine learning training datasets. To illustrate, they edited more than [25 million objects in OpenStreetMap so far](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-19/openstreetmap-charts-a-controversial-new-direction).
