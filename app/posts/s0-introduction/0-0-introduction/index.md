Our Data Team is one of the most prolific and accomplished mapping teams in the world. We have extensive experience with the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, geospatial software ecosystem and metadata standards. We are also at the forefront of building open and highly efficient workflows for mapping and building complex machine learning training datasets. To illustrate, our team edited more than 25 million objects in OpenStreetMap so far.
