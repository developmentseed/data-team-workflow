At the end of 2016, the members of the Data team were part of the road network mapping and alignment efforts in Taiwan, this work was carried out based on an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data quality study in Taiwan with respect to the Satellite imagery. By running a comparison against Bing Imagery and available GPS traces like [Strava Heat Map](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Strava), in which a notable data offset of 15-20 meters was observed with respect to GPS traces.

With respect to data realignment, there have been some discussions on the [Taiwan mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-tw/2016-September/001313.html) and members of Taiwan community have expressed their support in fixing these alignment problems.

The Data team has aligned <b>64,680kms of road network</b> in Taiwan which forms the <b>54.4%</b> of entire Taiwan road network. The overall project consisted of <b>43</b> tasking manager tasks covering <b>27,000 kmÂ²</b> which is <b>74%</b> of total area of the country.

The 6 cities where the aligning effort is concentrated are: Taipei, New Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Yilan and Tainan.
