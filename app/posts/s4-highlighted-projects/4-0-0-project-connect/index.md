UNICEF Innovation Office is in charge to map every school in Kenya, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Niger, Honduras, Ghana, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, applying scalable machine learning over high-resolution satellite imagery, with the aim of accelerating connectivity, online learning and other initiatives for children and their communities and driving economic stimulus under UNICEF's GIGA mission, particularly in low-income countries. Read more of the [Project Connect technical report](http://devseed.com/project-connect-docs/).

DevelopmentSeed data team generated a high-quality training dataset for machine learning models using as data source; schools provided by UNICEF and schools data from OpenStreetMap. In addition to the training data generation, the data team performed a validation of the ML outputs.

-- Stats

**Stats:**
Among all these countries, the data team validated around **120k schools** points for generating the training dataset, and more than **113k schools** from the ML outputs.
The below gift shows the comparison between the schools validated for training data and the results from ML outputs validation for Kenya. You can also see more about the [schools map visualizations](http://devseed.com/project-connect-visualizations/) for the rest of countries.
