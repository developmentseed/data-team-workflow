This mapping project was to support The World Bank Groupâ€™s Global Operations Support Team (GOST) in improving the quality of data in OpenStreetMap (OSM) in 21 AOI's related to issues of forced displacement (refugees and IDPs) located in Chad.

The mapping and improvement of the existing OSM data were focused mainly on buildings and roads. Among the <b>21 camps</b> mapped in this project, the Data team added/improved <b>1,144 km</b> of roads and more than <b>168,300 buildings</b>.
