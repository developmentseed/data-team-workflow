The Data Team mapped more than <b>67,742 farms</b> in North America, the main goal of this was to identify agricultural areas and determine the limits of crop fields. The Data team average, for doing the mapping field farms, varies according to the farm complexity.

On this project, the Data team saw fit to customize the JOSM tool, where mappers can use only shortcuts in order to add specific labels to the farm, doing the Data team work faster.
