At the beginning of 2018 Development seed and the World Bank ran a project of Identification on HV, Infrastructure for developing countries, Pakistan, Zambia, and Nigeria.

The strategy was, running an ML to identify tower across of those 3 countries and then Data team jump to map those places, this was a really challenging work, making the organization of the resources in ML and on the Mapping side.

Data team completed the work in around <b>2,540,099 kmÂ²</b> in approximately 132 days, editing <b>131,832 objects</b> in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
