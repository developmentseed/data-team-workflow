At the beginning of 2018 Development seed and the World Bank ran a project of Identification on HV, Infrastructure for developing countries, Pakistan, Zambia, and Nigeria.
The strategy was, Running an ML to identify tower across of those 3 countries and then Data-team jump to map those places, This was a really challenging work, making the organization of the resources in ML and on the Mapping side.

We completed the work in around **2,540,099 km2** in approximately 132 days, editing **131,832 objects** in [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).
