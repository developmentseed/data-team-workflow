The Data team with [Mercy Corps](https://www.mercycorps.org/) worked together in order to do a mapping/analysis in response to Indonesian Earthquake, which was on October 15, 2018.

The villages they were specifically interested in were Sembulan Lawang and Sembulan Bumbung. The main purpose was to count and locations of buildings that were before and after the earthquake, with an indication of whether the building was damaged or not in after the earthquake, using imagery available through Digital Globe's Open Data program.

The Data team worked on 2 phases:

<b>1. Pre-event:</b>

The Data team used imagery available that were taken before 15th October, then the team mapped <b>8,860 buildings</b> in the 2 villages areas.

<b>2. Post-event:</b>

The Data team used imagery available that were taken after 15th October, then the team mapped 8,857 buildings where <b>330 buildings</b> were <b>damaged buildings</b>, <b>648 buildings</b> as <b>collapsed buildings</b>, and there were <b>7,879 buildings, not any damage</b>, apart from identifying damaged and collapsed buildings, the Data team added <b>1,008 shelter camps as social facilities</b>, having a total of buildings as <b>9,865 buildings mapped</b>, all of them were added according to the imagery.

Finally, having the 2 phases, the Data team created a ["layer switcher/slider" app](http://devseed.com/mercycorps-data-visualization/) to show the before and after the earthquake, this app was useful for identifying which buildings were affected by the earthquake and bringing help to people who had been affected.
