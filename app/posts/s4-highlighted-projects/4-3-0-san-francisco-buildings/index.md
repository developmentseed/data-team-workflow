As the main goal for improving the data of buildings in San Francisco, the Data team mapped buildings in 2 cities as Menlo Park and Mountain View, so <b>173,447 buildings</b> were added. In order to do mapping work easier and faster, the Data team uses the [building plugin](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Plugins/BuildingsTools) that is available on [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) (Java OpenStreetMap Editor).
