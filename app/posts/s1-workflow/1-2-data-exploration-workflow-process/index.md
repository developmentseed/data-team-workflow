This process involves two important activities: data exploration and the engineering process.
 
**Data exploration:**
In this activity, the Data team gets trained and becomes familiar with the classes to be annotated, the Data team performs an exploration of the classes of interest to recognize and document them, and then they set up an efficient workflow that will align with the required annotation type and the annotation tool.
 
**Engineering process:**
Some projects may require annotation tool customization according to the inputs data, the Data team has vast experiences on tool customization, it helps to increase the annotation speed, in some cases it is required only a data transformation on which the Data team writes scripts to make the data conversion, in order to use as input in the annotation tools.
