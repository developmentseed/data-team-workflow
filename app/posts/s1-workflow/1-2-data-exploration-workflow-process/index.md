This process involves two important activities: data exploration and the engineering process.
 
**Data exploration:**
In this activity, the Data team gets trained and becomes familiar with the classes to be annotated, the Data team performs an exploration of the classes of interest to recognize and document them, and then they set up an efficient workflow that will align with the required annotation type and the annotation tool.
 
**Engineering process:**
Some projects may require annotation tool customization according to the inputs data, the Data team has vast experiences on tool customization, it helps to increase the annotation speed, but in some cases it is required only a data transformation on which the Data team writes scripts to make the data conversion, in order to use as input in the annotation tools.
 
## Data annotation process
 
As soon as the Data team has the data input ready to use it in the annotation tool and a well-documented annotation workflow, the Data team performs the data annotation or mapping. The below list show the different annotation types that the Data team works:
 
- [Image classification](/../annotation-type/image-classification/)
- [Object detection](/../annotation-type/object-detection/)
- [Segmentation](/../annotation-type/segmentation/)
- [Mapping](/../mapping/mapping/)
