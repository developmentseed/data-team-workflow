Development Seed's Data team has a structured and efficient workflow that involves the necessary processes and activities to generate a high-quality training dataset, and this helps them speed up the annotation process.

Once the Data team knows the requirements of the customer and has access to the [data input](/../workflow/data-input/), they start the development of the project based on their workflow that contains three main processes: [data exploration & workflow](/../workflow/data-exploration-workflow/), [data annotation](/../workflow/data-annotation/), and [delivering data output](/../workflow/delivering-data-output/). In each of these processes, different activities are developed until the training data is obtained.
 
Along the processes on the workflow, [quality assurance](/../workflow/quality-assurance/) process and a  [continuous communication](/../workflow/continuous-communication/) were embedded to ensure the training data aligns with the customer's expectations.
