Development Seed's Data team has a structured and efficient workflow that includes all the processes necessary to generate high-quality training datasets, which in turn helps speed up the data annotation process.

Once the project requirements and [data inputs](/workflow/data-input/) are established, the project development workflow contains three main processes: [data exploration and engineering](/workflow/data-exploration-and-engineering/), [data annotation](/workflow/data-annotation/), and [data output](/workflow/data-output/). Customized workflows are developed and refined within each process until the training dataset is complete.
 
Alongside the technical workflow customization during project development, [quality assurance](/workflow/quality-assurance/) and [continuous communication](/workflow/continuous-communication/) ensure the training data aligns with the partnerâ€™s expectations.

In the following sections about our workflow processes, you can find more details:

- [Data input](/workflow/data-input/)
- [Data exploration and engineering](/workflow/data-exploration-and-engineering/)
- [Data annotation](/workflow/data-annotation/)
- [Data output](/workflow/data-output/)
- [Quality assurance](/workflow/quality-assurance/)
- [Continuous communication](/workflow/continuous-communication/)
