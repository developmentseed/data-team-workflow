Development Seed's Data team has a structured and efficient workflow that involves the necessary processes and activities to generate a high-quality training dataset, and this helps them speed up the annotation process.

Once the Data team knows the requirements of the customer and has access to the data input, they start the development of the project based on their workflow that contains 3 main phases: data exploration and workflow setup, annotation process, and output data process; in each of these phases, different activities are developed until the training data is obtained.

During all of these phases, the Data team is in constant communication with the customer to ensure that their requirements are met and provide feedback on the annotated classes to ensure they are suitable for machine learning models.

### Data input

The Data team has extensive experience in handling different data formats, such as vector data, street view images, raster data and map layers.


### Data exploration and workflow

This phase involves two important tasks: data exploration and the engineering process.

**Data exploration:**
In this task, the Data team gets trained and becomes familiar with the classes to be annotated, the Data team performs an exploration of the classes of interest to recognize and document them, and then they set up an efficient workflow that will align with the required annotation type and the annotation tool.

**Engineering process:**
Each project that comes into the hands of the Data team has its own complexity and that is why it is necessary to customize the annotation tool, also the Data team needs to create scripts to be able to transform the input data in order to adjust and use it comfortably in the tool, all this makes the annotation simple using all possible means to make it happen.

### Data annotation

As soon as the Data team has the data input ready to use it in the customized annotation tool and a well-documented annotation workflow, the Data team performs the data annotation to produce image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation training datasets for the ML projects.

### Data output

Once the Data team completes the data annotation, if it is necessary, some data processing is done over the output data from the annotation tool in order to get it in the correct format to finally obtain the training data.
In this phase, the Data team also obtains the stats of the output data and provides reports and feedbacks to the customer about the different classes that were annotated.
