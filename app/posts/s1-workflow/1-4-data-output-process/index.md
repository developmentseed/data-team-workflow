Once data annotation is complete, some final activities include:
 
- Delivering data output in the format the partner needs; sometimes, this requires data format conversion, and the Data team will write a script to convert the data. Data is then delivered to the partner.
- Summary statistics are generated about the data annotation. For example, how many classes have been created in the whole dataset.
- Project feedback; both the partner and the Data team provide feedback to each other about what went well and what could be improved in future projects.
