The Data team is fully aware that data quality is directly related to the effectiveness of AI/ML models, so, ensuring data quality is of great importance, so, the Data team embedded the Quality Assurance (QA) process in its workflow in such a way that it allows guaranteeing a continuous improvement of the training data during the data annotation process and the delivering data output process.

Good practices that the Data team follow to deliver high-quality training data are:

- Internal revision; the Data team does a manual data validation of the first bunch of the annotated data to ensure that all the annotators are following the same perspective in the labeling and to find possible common issues in advance.
- Feedback from customers; the Data team sends one first dataset of the annotation in order to have a revision of the customers and receive feedback.
- Validations scripts; in addition to manual data revision, the Data team writes scripts to find issues in the data automatically and issues that can escape the human eyes, thus speeding up the data validation.
