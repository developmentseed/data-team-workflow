As soon as the Data team has the data input ready to use it in the annotation tool and a well-documented annotation workflow, the Data team performs the data annotation or mapping. The below list show the different annotation types that the Data team works:
 
- [Image classification](/../annotation-type/image-classification/)
- [Object detection](/../annotation-type/object-detection/)
- [Segmentation](/../annotation-type/segmentation/)
- [Mapping](/../mapping/mapping/)
