The data input for a project could be vector data, street view images, raster data, satellite imagery, and map layers (e.g. TMS, WMS, COGS, TIFF, etc.). The Data team has extensive experience handling all these data formats without any issues.

In some projects, partners provide their data to be processed, or you may want to use public data. One annotation project can have multiple data sources and involve different data formats. The data inputs will, in part, dictate the complexity of the workflow.
