Once the data annotation is completed, some last activities is required:
 
- Delivering data output in the format the customer requires; sometimes it may require data format conversion and the Data team needs to write a script to convert the data. Also upload the data to the customer repositories.
- Stats generation about the data annotation; for example, how many classes have been created in the whole dataset.
- Project feedback; in order to generate trust between customer and the Data team, providing feedback will be great for both ends, about what went well, what we could do better for future projects.
